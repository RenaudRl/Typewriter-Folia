# Cinematics

:::info[Before starting]
This guide assumes that you have already installed the [Basic Extension](../../02-getting-started/01-installation.mdx#basic-extension).\
Also, make sure you have read the [layout](../../02-getting-started/02-layout.mdx) documentation and created a **cinematic** page.
:::

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create and view cinematics in your interactions!

## What are cinematics?
Cinematics are timed sequences of actions that can be played in your interactions. They are used to create cutscenes or other timed events.

## Creating a cinematic
Let's get started by creating a simple camera cinematic.

### Adding a camera cinematic
Firstly click on the + icon in the top right corner of the panel and search for `Add Camera Cinematic`. Add it to your page by clicking on the + icon.

<EntrySearch entryName='cinematic'/>

### Creating a segment
Now we need to add a segment to our track. You can do this by clicking on the `New Camera Cinematic` entry in your page and by operations clicking on `Add Segment`(1).

After you create the segment, you can click on it (2). This opens the inspector of the segment.

### Modifying the camera segment
In a camera cinematic segment, you have a path. Each path contains a list of locations in a world of your server. When multiple locations are specified on a path, the player will move between them. If only one is specified, the player will stay stationary.
To create a path, click on the + icon in the inspector at `path(0)`.

To set a location in a path, you have 2 options: using the content mode or configuring it yourself.
#### Using the content mode 
The content mode allows you to get the player's current location and fill in the fields for you.

#### Configuring it yourself
You can also configure the paths yourself. This can be done by opening the `Path #1` field. In there, you can configure the location of the path. These are:
* **World**: The world where the cinematic happens.
* **X**: The x coordinate of the location.
* **Y**: The y coordinate of the location.
* **Z**: The z coordinate of the location.
* **Pitch**: The pitch of the camera.
* **Yaw**: The yaw of the camera.

**Duration**: The duration of the location to the next location in ticks. Understanding how this works is crucial for creating smooth cinematics.

### Understanding Duration

The duration for a path point is the amount of **frames (ticks)** it will take from that point to the **next point**.

Key principles:
1. **Last point's duration is ignored** \
-> there's no "next" point to move to
2. **Sum of durations must equal segment duration** \
-> all movement time must add up
3. **Unspecified durations are auto-calculated** \
-> remaining time is split evenly

#### Example: 4 Points, 100 Frame Segment

**Setup:**
- **Point 1**: Duration unspecified
- **Point 2**: Duration 50 frames  
- **Point 3**: Duration unspecified
- **Point 4**: Duration 10 frames \
*(ignored - it's the last point)*

**Result:**
- **Point 1 → Point 2**: 25 frames \
*(auto-calculated)*
- **Point 2 → Point 3**: 50 frames \
*(as specified)*
- **Point 3 → Point 4**: 25 frames \
*(auto-calculated)*

*Auto-calculated durations:* \
`(100 - 50) ÷ 2 = 25 frames each`

</Section>
</SplitLayout>

:::tip[Pro Tip]
With only 2 points, specifying duration is unnecessary since it must equal the total segment duration. Leave it unspecified for automatic calculation!
:::

Repeat this process to make more locations in the path.

## result
For the result we are going to use the example for the duration. You can easily view your cinematic by running the command:\
 `/tw cinematic start (page name)` or adding an `Add cinematic` to a sequence page.
