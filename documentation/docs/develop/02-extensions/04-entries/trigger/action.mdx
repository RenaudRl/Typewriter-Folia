# ActionEntry

The `ActionEntry` defines an action to take. When it is triggered, it will run it's `execute` method.
After which it will trigger all the next entries in the chain.

:::danger[Immutable Entry]
It is important to stress that the entry must be immutable.
**It cannot have any mutable state.**
:::

## Usage
<CodeSnippet tag="action_entry" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

Typewriter will automatically trigger the next entries in the chain after the `execute` method is called, and apply all the modifiers.

Sometimes you want to have a little more control over when the next triggers are triggered, or what triggers are triggered.

<CodeSnippet tag="action_entry_manual" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

## Working with Interaction Context

Action entries can both read from and modify the interaction context, making them powerful tools for data manipulation and conditional logic.

Action entries can access data stored in the interaction context by previous entries or add/update values in the interaction context for use by subsequent entries:

<CodeSnippet tag="entry_context_keys" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />
<CodeSnippet tag="global_context_key" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />
<CodeSnippet tag="action_context_basic" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

For more detailed information about interaction context, see the [Interaction Context](../../05-interactions/context.mdx) guide.
