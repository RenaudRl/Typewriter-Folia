# Asset & Artifact Entries
Assets and artifacts are both handled through similar interfaces that extend `StaticEntry`. Assets are static files like images, sounds, or other external resources, while artifacts are assets that are generated by the server at runtime.

## AssetEntry
The `AssetEntry` is primarily used for handling static assets. Assets can include various types of files such as images, data, or other external resources that can be used by an extension.

## ArtifactEntry
The `ArtifactEntry` is a specialized interface derived from `AssetEntry`. Its primary purpose is to handle artifacts, which are assets generated by the extensions. Unlike standard assets, artifacts are usually dynamic and created during runtime and stored between restarts. This makes them particularly useful for storing data arbitrary configuration data. As artifacts loaded in on reload, they are not suitable for storing real-time data.

## Usage

### Defining an AssetEntry
<CodeSnippet tag="asset_entry" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

### Defining an ArtifactEntry
<CodeSnippet tag="artifact_entry" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

## Accessing Asset & Artifact Content

### Using AssetManager (Traditional Approach)

#### String Content
<CodeSnippet tag="asset_access" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

#### Binary Content
<CodeSnippet tag="asset_binary_access" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

### Using Helper Methods (Recommended Approach)

Both `AssetEntry` and `ArtifactEntry` also provide convenient helper methods for accessing and storing data:

<CodeSnippet tag="asset_helper_methods" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />

The same helper methods work for artifacts:

<CodeSnippet tag="artifact_helper_methods" json={require("../../../snippets.json")} />
